# Lightning Components for SalesForce Community 
## Purpose
The main reasons I created this repository are for backup and portfolio purposes. This project was built with SalesForce Lightning to create two different Salesforce Communities. Because our resources were tight, I worked hard to avoid duplicating components when the only difference would be stylistic. I did this by using the design bundle (.design files) to edit attributes in the builder's property editor.
